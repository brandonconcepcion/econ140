We *do* see that the marginal impact of decreasing class size by one student *does* seem to increase the average test score as a whole. However, a difference of 2 points has still not been revealed as statistically significant. As seen in the previous question, if the California government made it absolutely necessary for a 2-point improvement in test scores, for every reduction in class size by 1 student, at a 95% confidence level we would be **unable** to provide a statistically significant outcome.\n",

Revising our model from a Simple Linear Regression model to a Multiple Linear Regression model could be more robust, and could help with identifying the key areas of imporvement for students. \n",
